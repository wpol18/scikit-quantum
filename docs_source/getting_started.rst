Getting Started
--------------------------
In quantum computing, we exploit strange behaviour of particles to perform computation, such phenomena include entanglement, superposition, and interference. Many quantum algorithms offer an exponential speed up compared to their classical counterparts -- enabling us to solve a swath of problems that were previously considered to be infeasible.

scikit-quantum is aimed to provide a user-friendly API while still harnessing the power of a quantum device.


Getting Started with scikit-quantum
===================================

To install scikit-quantum, run the following command:

.. code-block::

	python3 -m pip install scikit-quantum
